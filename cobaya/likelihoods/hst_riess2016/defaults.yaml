    # angconversion converts inverse of the angular diameter
    # distance at z = zeff to H0 or the fiducial cosmology
    # (omega_k = 0, omega_lambda = 0.7, w = -1).
    # Likelihood is in terms of inverse of the angular
    # diameter distance, so includes the tiny cosmological
    # dependence of the measurement (primarily on w) correctly.
